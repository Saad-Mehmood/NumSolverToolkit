# Simulations

Physics simulations are computational models used to mimic and study the behavior of physical systems under various conditions. By solving complex mathematical equations that govern the laws of nature, these simulations provide insights into phenomena that are often difficult or impossible to observe experimentally. From modeling the motion of celestial bodies to studying quantum mechanics, physics simulations enable scientists to test hypotheses, visualize dynamic processes, and make predictions about real-world systems. They play a crucial role in advancing scientific understanding and engineering applications by offering a controlled, reproducible environment for experimentation.
