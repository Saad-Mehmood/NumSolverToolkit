## Introduction

**NumSolverToolkit** is a personal project that explores a range of numerical methods used to solve mathematical problems that are difficult or impossible to tackle analytically. Through this project, I aim to deepen my understanding of key techniques in numerical analysis, such as numerical integration, differentiation, root finding, and solving differential equations. By providing detailed explanations, example problems, and interactive simulations, this repository serves as both a learning tool for myself and a potential resource for anyone interested in mastering these fundamental numerical methods.

The majority of the codes in this repository will be written in Python but there will be copies of codes in the repository that will be written in C++ or other such languages in case we require speed up for codes.

## Structure of the Repo

The repository is organized into four primary categories that reflect the core areas of numerical analysis:

1. **Numerical Integration**
2. **Numerical Differentiation**
3. **Root-Finding Methods**
4. **Differential Equations**

Each category contains dedicated subfolders for specific methods. For instance, within the **Numerical Integration** folder, there is a subfolder named **Monte Carlo Methods**. Each subfolder houses detailed theoretical documentation and accompanying code implementations for the respective techniques.
