## Overview

Welcome to **NumSolverToolkit**! This repository is dedicated to providing an intuitive and interactive approach to understanding and implementing various numerical methods. We cover a wide range of techniques, including:

- Euler's Method
- Runge-Kutta Methods (RK4)
- Newton-Raphson Method
- Trapezoidal Rule
- And more!

Each method is accompanied by detailed explanations, example problems, and simulations to help you grasp the concepts effectively.

## Introduction

Numerical methods are essential tools for solving mathematical problems that are difficult or impossible to solve analytically. This repository aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice by offering hands-on coding examples and simulations that demonstrate how these methods work in real-world scenarios.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/NumSolverToolkit.git
